# invokescript Method

Returns the result after passing a script through the VM.

:::note

- This method is to test your VM script as if they ran on the blockchain at that point in time. This RPC call does not affect the blockchain in any way.

- You must install the plugin [RpcServer](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules/releases) before you can invoke the method.

:::

## Parameter Description

- script: A script runnable in the VM. This is the same script that is returned in invokefunction
- signers or witnesses: Optional. This parameter can optionally be filled with a **list of signature accounts** for the transaction or a **list of witness** for the transaction.
  
  The structure of **signers** is as follows:
  
  - account: signature account
  
  - scopes: signature's valid scopes, allowed values are:
    - None: Only transactions are signed and no contracts are allowed to use this signature.
    - CalledByEntry: It only applies to the chain call entry. That is,  if the user invokes contract A, and then contract A calls contract B, only contract A can use the signature. It is recommended as the default value for the wallet.
    - CustomContracts: Custom contract. The signature can be used in the specified contract.
      It can be used in conjunction with CalledByEntry.
    - CustomGroups: Custom contract groups that can be used in a specified contract group.
      It can be used in conjunction with CalledByEntry.
    - Global: Global. The risk is extremely high because the contract may transfer all assets in the address. Only choose it when the contract is extremely trusted.
  
  - allowedcontracts: contracts of the signature can take effect, if scopes is CustomContracts
  
  - allowedgroups: pubkeys of the signature can take effect, if scopes is CustomGroups
  
  The structure of **witnesses** is as follows:
  
  - invocation: InvocationScript in Base64 encoded format.
  - verification: VerificationScript in Base64 encoded format.

Response body:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": {
        "script": "DAlqdXN0IHRlc3QRDBRWyI0UCtLMDykDfdEKfwBgorUoXAwU19eXMOJ4xtkG5uj2lb+th34/+pAUwB8MCHRyYW5zZmVyDBTPduKL0AYsSkeO41VhARMZ88+k0kFifVtS",
        "state": "HALT",
        "gasconsumed": "997796",
        "exception": null,
        "stack": [
            {
                "type": "Boolean",
                "value": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

- state:  `HALT` means the vm executed successfully, and`FAULT` means the vm exited due to an exception. 
- gasconsumed: the system fee consumed for invocation.
- stack: the contract execution result. If the value is String or ByteArray, it is encoded by Base64.
